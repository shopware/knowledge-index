# Field Configuration

With the [relevance](relevance), the Advanced Search offers the possibility to customize the searched fields.

Here, we want to give you brief information about the internal usage of the different Elasticsearch functionalities used for the full text search of the Advanced Search.

## Filter

The Advanced Search adds some additional filters, which will be used by the [Analyzer](field-config#analyzer).

1. **Numeric-Char-Filter \(`sesNumericCharFilter`\)** - The *numeric char filter* separates strings and numbers, and it normalizes the different spelling issues mostly found in shops.

With the help of this filter, a partial hit can be better found. For example:

   Input: `10KG`

   Output: `10 KG`

It uses the regex `(\d*)([^\d]*)` and replaces it with `$1 $2`

1. **Character Filter \(`sesCharFilter`\)** - The *char filter* separates strings from special characters \(supported special chars: `-,.\Â®"/`\).

When words are separated by one of these characters, the special character is removed and replaced by whitespace.

    1. **N-Gram Filter \(`ses_ngram`\)** - This *n-gram filter* uses the elastic search default [n-gram filter](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-ngram-tokenizer.html) with the parameters 3 for minimum and 27 for maximum value.

    2. **Shingle \(`ses_shingle`\)** - This *shingle filter* uses the elastic search default [shingle](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/analysis-shingle-tokenfilter.html)

    The parameters for this analyzer are:

       * Minimum shingle size -&gt; 2
       * Maximum shingle size -&gt; 3
       * Output Unigrams -&gt; false

    3. **Synonym \(`ses_synonym`\)** - In the Advanced Search you can define synonyms. These [synonyms](synonyms) are used by the search analyzer.

## Analyzer

In addition to the Shopware Elasticsearch default analyzer, the Advanced Search adds some additional analyzer. Each analyzer uses a different set of filters. Here is a list of all used custom analyzers in the Advanced Search:

1. `sesAnalyzer` -   It is the default [Analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analyzer.html) for the content. Filters used are: `sesCharFilter`, `sesNumericCharFilter`.

1. `sesNgramAnalyzer` -  Each string field that is indexed has an internal mapping for an extra field with the suffix `.ngram`. You can configure which field should be used in the [Administration module](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/enterprise-extensions/enterprise-search?category=shopware-6-en/enterprise-extensions#Configuration). Filters used are: `ses_ngram`, `sesCharFilter`, `sesNumericCharFilter`.

1. `sesShingleAnalyzer` -  Each string field that is indexed has an internal mapping for an extra field with the suffix `.ngram`. You can configure which field should be used in the [Administration module](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/enterprise-extensions/enterprise-search?category=shopware-6-en/enterprise-extensions#Configuration). Filters used are: `ses_shingle`, `sesCharFilter`, `sesNumericCharFilter`.

1. `sesSearchAnalyzer` -  It is the default [Search analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-analyzer.html) for the search words. Filters used are: `synonym`.
