# Installation

Similar to the Shopware Core production and development templates, it is possible to set up SESP as a `dependency/composer` requirement and as a development environment allowing you to contribute to the plugin on its own.

::: warning
To contribute, please get in touch with the Shopware Sales department so as to get access to the private repository.
