# PaaS

::: info
Shopware PaaS is available at request for Shopware merchants. Please approach the Shopware Sales to get more information on Shopware PaaS
:::

Shopware PaaS is a platform-as-a-service to host, deploy and scale for your individual Shopware project.
It comes with full flexibility and code ownership of a self-hosted Shopware project, but takes away the complexity of building custom infrastructure, build and testing pipelines, or deployment automation.

Get started by installing the PaaS CLI on your local development machine.
